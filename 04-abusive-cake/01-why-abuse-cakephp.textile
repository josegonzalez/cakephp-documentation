h1. Why Abuse CakePHP?

# Because you need it to do something evil
# Because you are on a deadline
# Because CakePHP doesn't support what you want it to do
# Because the default behavior is wrong
# Because you have to work around other developers

h2. Things to know

Good CakePHP developers will hate you. I will hate you. The IRC channel will be so upset with you.

But there are times when the abuse is warranted. We do what we must because we can.

This is a list of bad things I never recommend doing because you will break CakePHP for other developers. They will be very upset at your application's weird behavior. Maintenance will be a disaster. But your app will work.
